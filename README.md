# Bike-Sharing-Predict
> This project focuses on predicting the demand for shared bikes in the American market using Multiple Linear Regression. The dataset contains various independent variables such as weather conditions, seasons, time, and user types that influence bike demand. The goal is to build a regression model that helps BoomBikes understand demand patterns and optimize their business strategy post-COVID-19.

## General Information
- Bike-sharing systems provide short-term bike rentals via automated docks. Due to COVID-19, BoomBikes faced a drop in demand and revenue. To recover, they need a data-driven strategy to predict bike demand and optimize operations.
- BoomBikes wants to understand key factors driving bike demand to:
- The bsuiness objectives are :
  -Optimize bike availability in high-demand areas.
  -Improve pricing and marketing strategies.
  -Plan future expansions based on demand patterns.

- The dataset includes daily bike rentals with factors like:
  -Time: Season, holiday, weekday, year.
  -Weather: Temperature, humidity, wind speed.
  -Users: Casual, registered, total rentals (target variable: cnt).
  This helps in forecasting demand and making data-driven decisions for business growth.



## Conclusions
This project successfully built a Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict bike-sharing demand based on various time, weather, and user-related factors. The key takeaways from the analysis are:

-Significant Factors: Features like year, month, temperature, humidity, and weekday play a crucial role in determining bike demand.
-Model Performance: The model achieved a high R-squared score of 84.14 on training data and 81.08% on testing data.
-Business Impact: Insights from this model can help BoomBikes optimize bike availability, improve marketing strategies, and make data-driven business decisions.
Overall, this predictive model provides valuable insights into demand dynamics, helping BoomBikes recover post-pandemic and maximize profitability.
